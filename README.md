# AI For Dyslexia

## Overview
AI For Dyslexia is an AI-powered tool designed to assist individuals with dyslexia by improving text readability, correcting letter reversals, enhancing word recognition, and providing adaptive reading support. This project leverages machine learning, OpenCV, and AI-driven text processing to make reading more accessible and comfortable for dyslexic users.

## Features
- **Letter Reversal & Orientation Correction**: Uses OCR and AI post-processing to identify and correct reversed letters.
- **AI-Driven Color Overlays & Background Adjustments**: Implements OpenCV for customizable color filters to enhance readability.
- **AI-Powered Text Customization**: Adjusts letter spacing and highlights phonetics for better word differentiation.
- **AI-Based Screen Adjustments**: Utilizes webcam-based eye-tracking to dynamically adjust text positioning.
- **AI-Powered Phonetic Correction**: Integrates LanguageTool API for advanced spelling, grammar, and phonetic corrections.
- **AI Summary & Questioning System**: Uses GPT-based AI to summarize text and generate comprehension questions.
- **Adaptive Contrast Testing System**: Dynamically adjusts contrast based on user feedback, response time, and eye-tracking data.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- LanguageTool API
- OpenAI's GPT API (for AI-based text corrections and summarization)
